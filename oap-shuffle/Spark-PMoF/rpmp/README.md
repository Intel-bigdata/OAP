# RPMP(Remote Persistent Memory Pool)
RPMP was designed as a fully disaggregated shuffle solution for distributed compute system, leveraging state-of-art hardware technologies including persist memory and RDMA, but are not necessarily limited to a shuffle solution. It extends local PM(Persistent Memory) to remote PM and targets on a distributed persistent memory pool, providing easy-to-use interfaces, like the malloc and free in standard C library.
