/**
 * An iterator that fetches multiple blocks. For local blocks, it fetches from the local block
 * manager. For remote blocks, it fetches them using the provided BlockTransferService.
 *
 * This creates an iterator of (BlockID, InputStream) tuples so the caller can handle blocks
 * in a pipelined fashion as they are received.
 *
 * The implementation throttles the remote fetches so they don't exceed maxBytesInFlight to avoid
 * using too much memory.
 *
 * @param context [[TaskContext]], used for metrics update
 * @param shuffleClient [[ShuffleClient]] for fetching remote blocks
 * @param blockManager [[BlockManager]] for reading local blocks
 * @param blocksByAddress list of blocks to fetch grouped by the [[BlockManagerId]].
 *                        For each block we also require the size (in bytes as a long field) in
 *                        order to throttle the memory usage. Note that zero-sized blocks are
 *                        already excluded, which happened in
 *                        [[MapOutputTracker.convertMapStatuses]].
 * @param streamWrapper A function to wrap the returned input stream.
 * @param maxBytesInFlight max size (in bytes) of remote blocks to fetch at any given point.
 * @param maxReqsInFlight max number of remote requests to fetch blocks at any given point.
 * @param maxBlocksInFlightPerAddress max number of shuffle blocks being fetched at any given point
 *                                    for a given remote host:port.
 * @param maxReqSizeShuffleToMem max size (in bytes) of a request that can be shuffled to memory.
 * @param detectCorrupt whether to detect any corruption in fetched blocks.
