/**
  * An iterator that fetches multiple blocks. For local blocks, it fetches from the local block
  * manager. For remote blocks, it fetches them using the provided BlockTransferService.
  *
  * This creates an iterator of (BlockID, InputStream) tuples so the caller can handle blocks
  * in a pipelined fashion as they are received.
  *
  * The implementation throttles the remote fetches so they don't exceed maxBytesInFlight to avoid
  * using too much memory.
  *
  * @param context [[TaskContext]], used for metrics update
  * @param streamWrapper A function to wrap the returned input stream.
