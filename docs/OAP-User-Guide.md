## Prerequisites

OAP on Spark requires a working Hadoop cluster with YARN and Spark. Running Spark on YARN requires a binary distribution of Spark, which is built with YARN support. If you don't want to build Spark by yourself, we have pre-built [Spark-2.4.4](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/OAP/releases/download/v0.6.1-spark-2.4.4/spark-2.4.4-bin-hadoop2.7-patched.tgz).

## Getting Started with OAP

### Building OAP

Download our pre-built [OAP-0.7.0 for Spark 2.4.4 jar](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/OAP/releases/download/v0.6.1-spark-2.4.4/oap-0.6.1-with-spark-2.4.4.jar) to your working node and put the OAP `.jar` in your working directory: `/home/oap/jars/`. 

If you’d like to build OAP from source code, please refer to the [Developer Guide](Developer-Guide.md) for the detailed steps.

### Configure Spark for OAP

Users usually test and run Spark SQL or Scala scripts in Spark Shell, which launches Spark applications on YRAN in ***client*** mode. In this section, we will start with Spark Shell then introduce other use scenarios. 

Before you run ` . $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell `, configure Spark for OAP integration. Then add or update the following configurations in the Spark configuration file `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` on your working node.

```
spark.sql.extensions              org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions
spark.files                       /home/oap/jars/oap-0.7.0-with-spark-2.4.4.jar     # absolute path of OAP jar on your working node
spark.executor.extraClassPath     ./oap-0.7.0-with-spark-2.4.4.jar                  # relative path of OAP jar
spark.driver.extraClassPath       /home/oap/jars/oap-0.7.0-with-spark-2.4.4.jar     # absolute path of OAP jar on your working node
```
### Verify Spark with OAP Integration

After configuration, you can follow these steps to verify the OAP integration is working using Spark Shell.

1. Create a test data path on your HDFS. `hdfs:///user/oap/` for example.
   ```
   hadoop fs -mkdir /user/oap/
   
   ```
2. Launch Spark Shell using the following command on your working node.
   ``` 
   . $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell
   ```

3. Execute the following commands in Spark Shell to test OAP integration. 
   ```
   > spark.sql(s"""CREATE TABLE oap_test (a INT, b STRING)
          USING parquet
          OPTIONS (path 'hdfs:///user/oap/')""".stripMargin)
   > val data = (1 to 30000).map { i => (i, s"this is test $i") }.toDF().createOrReplaceTempView("t")
   > spark.sql("insert overwrite table oap_test select * from t")
   > spark.sql("create oindex index1 on oap_test (a)")
   > spark.sql("show oindex from oap_test").show()
   ```

This test creates an index for a table and then shows it. If there are no errors, the OAP `.jar` is working with the configuration. The picture below is an example of a successfully run.

![Spark_shell_running_results](./image/spark_shell_oap.png)

## Configure YARN Cluster Mode

Spark Shell, Spark SQL CLI, and Thrift Sever run the Spark applications in ***client*** mode. The Spark Submit tool can run the Spark application in ***client*** or ***cluster*** mode determined by the --deploy-mode parameter. See the [Getting Started with OAP](#getting-started-with-oap) guide for the configuration needed for ***client*** mode. If you are running the Spark Submit tool in ***cluster*** mode, you need to follow these steps instead.

Add the following OAP configuration settings to `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf` on your working node before running `spark-submit` in ***cluster*** mode.
```
spark.sql.extensions              org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions
spark.files                       /home/oap/jars/oap-0.7.0-with-spark-2.4.4.jar        # absolute path on your working node    
spark.executor.extraClassPath     ./oap-0.7.0-with-spark-2.4.4.jar                     # relative path 
spark.driver.extraClassPath       ./oap-0.7.0-with-spark-2.4.4.jar                     # relative path
```

## Configure Spark Standalone Mode

In addition to running on the YARN cluster manager, Spark also provides a simple standalone deploy mode. If you are using Spark in Spark Standalone mode:

1. Copy the OAP `.jar` to **all** the worker nodes. 
2. Add the following configuration settings to “$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults” on the working node.
   ```
   spark.sql.extensions               org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions
   spark.executor.extraClassPath      /home/oap/jars/oap-0.7.0-with-spark-2.4.4.jar      # absolute path on worker nodes
   spark.driver.extraClassPath        /home/oap/jars/oap-0.7.0-with-spark-2.4.4.jar      # absolute path on worker nodes
   ```

## Working with OAP Index

After a successful OAP integration, you can use OAP SQL DDL to manage table indexes. The DDL operations include `index create`, `drop`, `refresh`, and `show`. Test these functions using the following examples in Spark Shell.

```
> spark.sql(s"""CREATE TABLE oap_test (a INT, b STRING)
       USING parquet
       OPTIONS (path 'hdfs:///user/oap/')""".stripMargin)
> val data = (1 to 30000).map { i => (i, s"this is test $i") }.toDF().createOrReplaceTempView("t")
> spark.sql("insert overwrite table oap_test select * from t")       
```

### Index Creation

Use the CREATE OINDEX DDL command to create a B+ Tree index or bitmap index. 
``` 
CREATE OINDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name) USING [BTREE, BITMAP]
```
The following example creates a B+ Tree index on column "a" of the `oap_test` table.
``` 
> spark.sql("create oindex index1 on oap_test (a)")
```
Use SHOW OINDEX command to show all the created indexes on a specified table.
```
> spark.sql("show oindex from oap_test").show()
```
### Use OAP Index

Using index in a query is transparent. When SQL queries have filter conditions on the column(s) which can take advantage of the index to filter the data scan, the index will automatically be applied to the execution of Spark SQL. The following example will automatically use the underlayer index created on column "a".
```
> spark.sql("SELECT * FROM oap_test WHERE a = 1").show()
```

### Drop index

Use DROP OINDEX command to drop a named index.
```
> spark.sql("drop oindex index1 on oap_test")
```

## Working with OAP Cache

OAP can provide input data cache functionality to the executor. When using the cache data among different SQL queries, configure cache to allow different SQL queries to use the same executor process. Do this by running your queries through the Spark ThriftServer as shown below. For cache media, we support both DRAM and Intel DCPMM which means you can choose to cache data in DRAM or Intel DCPMM if you have DCPMM configured in hardware.

### Use DRAM Cache 

1. Make the following configuration changes in Spark configuration file `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf`. 

   ```
   spark.memory.offHeap.enabled                   false
   spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.memory.manager        offheap
   spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.offheap.memory.size   50g      # equal to the size of executor.memoryOverhead
   spark.executor.memoryOverhead                  50g      # according to the resource of cluster
   spark.sql.oap.parquet.data.cache.enable        true     # for parquet fileformat
   spark.sql.oap.orc.data.cache.enable            true     # for orc fileformat
   spark.sql.orc.copyBatchToSpark                 true     # for orc fileformat
   ```

   Change `spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.offheap.memory.size` based on the availability of DRAM capacity to cache data.

2. Launch Spark ***ThriftServer***

   Launch Spark Thift Server, and use the Beeline command line tool to connect to the Thrift Server to execute DDL or DML operations. The data cache will automatically take effect for Parquet or ORC file sources. 

   The rest of this section will show you how to do a quick verification of cache functionality. It will reuse the database metastore created in the [Working with OAP Index](#working-with-oap-index) section, which creates the `oap_test` table definition. In production, Spark Thrift Server will have its own metastore database directory or metastore service and use DDL's through Beeline for creating your tables.

   When you run ```spark-shell``` to create the `oap_test` table, `metastore_db` will be created in the directory where you ran '$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell'. Go to that directory and execute the following command to launch Thrift JDBC server.

   ```
   . $SPARK_HOME/sbin/start-thriftserver.sh
   ```

3. Use Beeline and connect to the Thrift JDBC server, replacing the hostname (mythriftserver) with your own Thrift Server hostname.

   ```
   ./beeline -u jdbc:hive2://mythriftserver:10000       
   ```

   After the connection is established, execute the following commands to check the metastore is initialized correctly.

   ```
   > SHOW databases;
   > USE default;
   > SHOW tables;
   ```
 
4. Run queries on the table that will use the cache automatically. For example,

   ```
   > SELECT * FROM oap_test WHERE a = 1;
   > SELECT * FROM oap_test WHERE a = 2;
   > SELECT * FROM oap_test WHERE a = 3;
   ...
   ```

5. Open the Spark History Web UI and go to the OAP tab page to see verify the cache metrics. The following picture is an example.

   ![webUI](./image/webUI.png)


### Use DCPMM Cache 

#### Prerequisites

The following are required to configure OAP to use DCPMM cache.

- Directories exposing DCPMM hardware on each socket. For example, on a two socket system the mounted DCPMM directories should appear as `/mnt/pmem0` and `/mnt/pmem1`. Correctly installed DCPMM must be formatted and mounted on every cluster worker node.

   ```
   // use impctl command to show topology and dimm info of DCPM
   impctl show -topology
   impctl show -dimm
   // provision dcpm in app direct mode
   ipmctl create -goal PersistentMemoryType=AppDirect
   // reboot system to make configuration take affect
   reboot
   // check capacity provisioned for app direct mode(AppDirectCapacity)
   impctl show -memoryresources
   // show the DCPM region information
   impctl show -region
   // create namespace based on the region, multi namespaces can be created on a single region
   ndctl create-namespace -m fsdax -r region0
   ndctl create-namespace -m fsdax -r region1
   // show the created namespaces
   fdisk -l
   // create and mount file system
   mount -o dax /dev/pmem0 /mnt/pmem0
   mount -o dax /dev/pmem1 /mnt/pmem1
   ```

   In thi case file systems are generated for 2 numa nodes, which can be checked by "numactl --hardware". For a different number of numa nodes, a corresponding number of namespaces should be created to assure correct file system paths mapping to numa nodes.

- [Memkind](http://memkind.github.io/memkind/) library installed on every cluster worker node. Use the latest Memkind version. Compile Memkind based on your system or place our pre-built binary of [libmemkind.so.0](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/OAP/releases/download/v0.6.1-spark-2.4.4/libmemkind.so.0) for x86 64bit CentOS Linux in the `/lib64/`directory of each worker node in cluster. The Memkind library depends on libnuma at the runtime, so it must already exist in the worker node system. 

   Build memkind lib from source:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/memkind/memkind
   cd memkind
   ./autogen.sh
   ./configure
   make
   make install
   ```

- Install [Vmemcache](https://github.com/pmem/vmemcache) library on every cluster worker node if using vmemcache strategy. Follow the build/install steps from vmemcache website and make sure libvmemcache.so is in `/lib64` directory in each worker node. 

   Build vmemcache lib from source (for RPM-based Linux):

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pmem/vmemcache
   cd vmemcache
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCPACK_GENERATOR=rpm
   make package
   sudo rpm -i libvmemcache*.rpm
   ```

#### Configure NUMA

1. Install `numactl` to bind the executor to the DCPMM device on the same NUMA node. 

   ```yum install numactl -y ```

2. Build Spark from source to enable numa-binding support. Refer to [enable-numa-binding-for-dcpmm-in-spark](./Developer-Guide.md#enable-numa-binding-for-dcpmm-in-spark).

#### Configure DCPMM 

Create `persistent-memory.xml` in `$SPARK_HOME/conf/` if it doesn't exist. Use the following template and change the `initialPath` to your mounted paths for DCPMM devices. 

```
<persistentMemoryPool>
  <!--The numa id-->
  <numanode id="0">
    <!--The initial path for Intel Optane DC persistent memory-->
    <initialPath>/mnt/pmem0</initialPath>
  </numanode>
  <numanode id="1">
    <initialPath>/mnt/pmem1</initialPath>
  </numanode>
</persistentMemoryPool>
```

#### Configure Spark/OAP to enable DCPMM cache

Make the following configuration changes in `$SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf`.

```
spark.executor.instances                                   6               # 2x number of your worker nodes
spark.yarn.numa.enabled                                    true            # enable numa
spark.executorEnv.MEMKIND_ARENA_NUM_PER_KIND               1
spark.memory.offHeap.enabled                               false
spark.speculation                                          false
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size    256g            # DCPMM capacity per executor
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.reserved.size   50g             # Reserved space per executor
spark.sql.extensions                  org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions   # Enable OAP jar in Spark
```

***Add OAP absolute path to `.jar` file in `spark.executor.extraClassPath` and` spark.driver.extraClassPath`.***

Change the values of `spark.executor.instances`, `spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size`, and `spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.reserved.size` to match your environment. 

- `spark.executor.instances`: We suggest setting the value to 2x the number of worker nodes when NUMA binding is enabled. Each worker node runs two executors, each executor is bound to one of the two sockets, and accesses the corresponding DCPMM device on that socket.
- `spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size`: It is configured to the available DCPMM capacity to be used as data cache per exectutor.
- `spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.reserved.size`: When we use DCPMM as memory through memkind library, some portion of the space needs to be reserved for memory management overhead, such as memory segmentation. We suggest reserving 20% - 25% of the available DCPMM capacity to avoid memory allocation failure. But even with an allocation failure, OAP will continue the operation to read data from original input data and will not cache the data block.

#### Choose additional configuration options

Optimize your environment by choosing a DCPMM caching strategy (guava, non-evictable, vmemcache). 

##### Guava cache

Guava cache is based on the memkind library and built on top of jemalloc. It provides additional memory characteristics. To use it in your workload, follow [DCPMM Cache](#use-dcpmm-cache) to set up DCPMM hardware and memkind library correctly. Then follow bellow configurations.

For Parquet data format, use these conf options:
```
spark.sql.oap.parquet.data.cache.enable           true
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.memory.manager           pm
spark.oap.cache.strategy                          guava
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size    *g
spark.sql.extensions                              org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions
```
For Orc data format, use these conf options:
```
spark.sql.orc.copyBatchToSpark                   true
spark.sql.oap.orc.data.cache.enable              true
spark.sql.oap.orc.enable                         true
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.memory.manager          pm
spark.oap.cache.strategy                         guava
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size      *g
spark.sql.extensions                             org.apache.spark.sql.OapExtensions
```

##### Non-evictable cache

The non-evictable cache strategy is also supported in OAP based on the memkind library for DCPMM.

The prerequisites to set up [DCPMM hardware](#use-dcpmm-cache) and memkind library apply.

For Parquet data format, use these conf options:
```
spark.sql.oap.parquet.data.cache.enable                  true 
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.memory.manager                  hybrid 
spark.oap.cache.strategy                                 noevict 
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size  256g 
```
For Orc data format, use these conf options:
```
spark.sql.orc.copyBatchToSpark                           true 
spark.sql.oap.orc.data.cache.enable                      true 
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.memory.manager                  hybrid 
spark.oap.cache.strategy                                 noevict 
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size  256g 
```

##### vmemcache Cache

The vmemcache cache strategy is based on libvmemcache (buffer based LRU cache), which provides a key-value store API. Follow these steps to enable vmemcache support in OAP.

Follow prerequisites to configure [DCPMM hardware](#use-dcpmm-cache) 

For Parquet data format, use these conf options:

```
 
spark.sql.oap.parquet.data.cache.enable                    true 
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.memory.manager                    tmp 
spark.oap.cache.strategy                                   vmem 
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size    256g 
spark.sql.oap.cache.guardian.memory.size                   10g      # according to your cluster
```

For Orc data format, use these conf options:

```
spark.sql.orc.copyBatchToSpark                             true 
spark.sql.oap.orc.data.cache.enable                        true 
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.memory.manager                    tmp 
spark.oap.cache.strategy                                   vmem 
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size    256g
spark.sql.oap.cache.guardian.memory.size                   10g      # according to your cluster   
```

Note: If "PendingFiber Size" (on spark web-UI OAP page) is large, or some tasks fail with "cache guardian use too much memory" error, set `spark.sql.oap.cache.guardian.memory.size ` to a larger number as the default size is 10GB. The user could also increase `spark.sql.oap.cache.guardian.free.thread.nums` or decrease `spark.sql.oap.cache.dispose.timeout.ms` to free memory more quickly.

##### Index/Data cache separation

OAP now supports different cache backends including `guava`, `vmemcache`, `simple` and `noevict`, for the `offheap` and `pm` cache managers. To optimize cache media utilization, enable cache separation of data and index with different cache media and strategies. 

For example, to use DRAM(`offheap`) for index cache and DCPMM(`pm`) for data cache, set these configuration values in `spark-defaults.conf`.

```
spark.sql.oap.index.data.cache.separation.enable          true 
spark.sql.oap.mix.index.memory.manager                    offheap
spark.sql.oap.mix.data.memory.manager                     pm
```

Or to use DRAM(`offheap`) with `guava` for index cache and DCPMM(`pm`) with `vmemcache` for data cache.

```
spark.sql.oap.index.data.cache.separation.enable          true
spark.oap.cache.strategy                                  mix
spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.memory.manager                   mix
spark.sql.oap.mix.index.cache.backend                     guava
spark.sql.oap.mix.index.memory.manager                    offheap
spark.sql.oap.mix.data.cache.backend                      vmem
spark.sql.oap.mix.data.memory.manager                     tmp
```

##### Binary cache 

A binary cache is available for both Parquet and ORC fileformat to improve cache space utilization compared to ColumnVector cache. When enabling binary cache, you should add following configs to `spark-defaults.conf`.

```
spark.sql.oap.parquet.binary.cache.enabled                true      # for parquet fileformat
spark.sql.oap.parquet.data.cache.enable                   false     # for ColumnVector, default is false
spark.sql.oap.orc.binary.cache.enable                     true      # for orc fileformat
spark.sql.oap.orc.data.cache.enable                       false     # for ColumnVector, default is false
```

#### Verify DCPMM cache functionality

After finishing configuration, restart Spark Thrift Server for the configuration changes to take effect. Start at step 2 of the [Use DRAM Cache](#use-dram-cache) guide to verify that cache is working correctly.

Verify NUMA binding status by confirming keywords like `numactl --cpubind=1 --membind=1` contained in executor launch command.

Check DCPMM cache size by checking disk space with `df -h`. For Guava/Non-evictable strategies, the command will show disk space usage increases along with workload execution. For vmemcache strategy, disk usage will reach the initial cache size once the DCPMM cache is initialized and will not change during workload execution.

## Run TPC-DS Benchmark for OAP Cache

This section provides instructions and tools for running TPC-DS queries to evaluate the cache performance of various configurations. The TPC-DS suite has many queries and we select 9 I/O intensive queries to simplify performance evaluation.

We created some tool scripts [OAP-TPCDS-TOOL.zip](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/OAP/releases/download/v0.6.1-spark-2.4.4/OAP-TPCDS-TOOL.zip) to simplify running the workload. If you are already familiar with TPC-DS data generation and running a TPC-DS tool suite, skip our tool and use the TPC-DS tool suite directly.

### Prerequisites

- Python 2.7+ is required on the working node. 

### Prepare the Tool

1. Download [OAP-TPCDS-TOOL.zip](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/OAP/releases/download/v0.6.1-spark-2.4.4/OAP-TPCDS-TOOL.zip) and unzip to a folder (for example, `OAP-TPCDS-TOOL` folder) on your working node. 
2. Copy `OAP-TPCDS-TOOL/tools/tpcds-kits` to ALL worker nodes under the same folder (for example, `/home/oap/tpcds-kits`).

### Generate TPC-DS Data

1. Update the values for the following variables in `OAP-TPCDS-TOOL/scripts/tool.conf` based on your environment and needs.

   - SPARK_HOME: Point to the Spark home directory of your Spark setup.
   - TPCDS_KITS_DIR: The tpcds-kits directory you coped to the worker nodes in the above prepare process. For example, /home/oap/tpcds-kits
   - NAMENODE_ADDRESS: Your HDFS Namenode address in the format of host:port.
   - THRIFT_SERVER_ADDRESS: Your working node address on which you will run Thrift Server.
   - DATA_SCALE: The data scale to be generated in GB
   - DATA_FORMAT: The data file format. You can specify parquet or orc

   For example:

  ```
  export SPARK_HOME=/home/oap/spark-2.4.4
  export TPCDS_KITS_DIR=/home/oap/tpcds-kits
  export NAMENODE_ADDRESS=mynamenode:9000
  export THRIFT_SERVER_ADDRESS=mythriftserver
  export DATA_SCALE=2
  export DATA_FORMAT=parquet
  ```

2. Start data generation.

   In the root directory of this tool (`OAP-TPCDS-TOOL`), run `scripts/run_gen_data.sh` to start the data generation process. 

   ```
   cd OAP-TPCDS-TOOL
   sh ./scripts/run_gen_data.sh
   ```

   Once finished, the `$scale` data will be generated in the HDFS folder `genData$scale`. And a database called `tpcds$scale` will contain the TPC-DS tables.

### Start Spark Thrift Server

Start the Thrift Server in the tool root folder, which is the same folder you run data generation scripts. Use either the DCPMM or DRAM scrip to start the Thrift Server.

#### Use DCPMM as cache

Update the configuration values in `scripts/spark_thrift_server_yarn_with_DCPMM.sh` to reflect your environment.   Normally, you need to update the following configuration values to cache to DCPMM.

- --driver-memory
- --executor-memory
- --executor-cores
- --conf spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.initial.size
- --conf spark.sql.oap.fiberCache.persistent.memory.reserved.size

These settings will override the values specified in Spark configuration file. After the configuration is done, you can execute the following command to start Thrift Server.

```
cd OAP-TPCDS-TOOL
sh ./scripts/spark_thrift_server_yarn_with_DCPMM.sh start
```

#### Use DRAM as cache
Update the configuration values in `scripts/spark_thrift_server_yarn_with_DRAM.sh` to reflect your environment. Normally, you need to update the following configuration values to cache to DRAM.

- --driver-memory
- --executor-memory
- --executor-cores
- --conf spark.memory.offHeap.size

These settings will override the values specified in Spark configuration file. After the configuration is done, you can execute the following command to start Thrift Server.

```
cd OAP-TPCDS-TOOL
sh ./scripts/spark_thrift_server_yarn_with_DRAM.sh  start
```

### Run Queries
Execute the following command to start to run queries.

```
cd OAP-TPCDS-TOOL
sh ./scripts/run_tpcds.sh
```

When all the queries are done, you will see the `result.json` file in the current directory.
